This repository has two codes. 

The first code scrapes information from Google News. It collects the date and time of the news and the link to the oage containing the news. However, only the title is displayed. For the search function, kindly replace the string to be searched for in the "query" variable. I use Sublime text editor which does not allow input functions and hence, I was unable to add the function. The data is stored in a .txt file. 

The second code scrapes stock data. It does so continuously with a refresh period of 30 seconds. If there is a change of 2% or greater, an alert is issued. The data is saved in an excel sheet.
